                    Hi! I’m Jennifer! I am 9 years old. I live in Houston, Texas with my mother, father, and two brothers. I like going to school but I hate doing homework and taking exams. At school I study English, Spanish, Science, Social Studies and Mathematics. I love going to school and seeing my friends and teachers every day. I also like to play baseball after school. I don’t have a sister but my best friend Olga is just like my sister. We tell each other everything. We also study and watch TV together. When I grow up I’m going to be a nurse and take care of sick people.
